                The Playstation 4 (PS4) generation of games were among some of the most groundbreaking in advances to graphics as well as gameplay 
                features. Looking back at that generation, we can see many trends both in what types of games developers and publishers were creating as 
                well as what games consumers enjoyed most. This visualization dives into both of those aspects of PS4 games by looking into the best 
                selling games of that generation to see what kind of games consumers loved the most and why that could be.
